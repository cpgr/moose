# Verification problems

The following verification problems are used to verify and validate the capability
of PorousFlow in modelling the physical processes involved in fluid and heat transport
in porous media, along with geomechanical effects.

Where possible, these problems compare the results from PorousFlow with analytical solutions
that have been published previously. Where no analytical solution exists (particularly for
more complicated models), the PorousFlow results are compared with published benchmark solutions
or with other codes as applicable.
